- Languages/tools used
    We used Python for everything. We also used Google protobuf, the socket
    library, and other low-level native Python libraries.

- How to compile/run
    Just type "make" to host a branch with a hard-coded name. You'll probably
    want to open a few terminals and name them yourself. You can do this with
    "python branch.py <name> <port> <interval>" - it's more practical. You can
    do "python controller.py <total_money> <branches text file>" to run the
    controller, too. Fill in the text file as necessary, like <name> remote<xx>
    <port>.

- The tasks both group members worked on
    Cris worked on the branches' snapshot and marker initialization, and threading.
    Kyle worked on the controller, the branch transfers, and controlling output.

- Completion status
    Everything works and has been tested extensively except for the sum of the
    snapshots. Sometimes the sum adds up correctly to the original amount of money
    specified by the controller arguments, and sometimes it doesn't. We spent a 
    very long time making sure that the transfers work with any number of nodes,
    and we didn't have enough time to fix the snapshot specifics. However, you can
    run infinitely many snapshots and have infinitely many transfers; it'll never
    break, and the transfers add up correctly. The only thing that sometimes doesn't
    give expected output is the sum of the elements in each snapshot.

- Anything else
    This was hard.
